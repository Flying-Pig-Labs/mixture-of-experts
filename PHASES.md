## 1. Ideation / Discovery

- Define the problem and opportunity space
- Conduct stakeholder interviews, market research, and user research
- Generate initial product ideas and feature hypotheses

## 2. Requirements / Scoping

- Document functional and non-functional requirements
- Define MVP scope and success criteria
- Prioritize features (MoSCoW, RICE, etc.)

## 3. Design / Architecture

- **UX**: User journeys, wireframes, user testing
- **UI**: Visual design, accessibility, design system integration
- **Technical**: System architecture, API contracts, data models

## 4. Planning / Backlog Grooming

- Create user stories, epics, milestones
- Define sprints or iterations
- Estimate effort (story points, hours)

## 5. Implementation / Development

- Write code: frontend, backend, infrastructure, mobile
- Integrate APIs, services, and third-party tools
- Version control, code review, feature flags

## 6. Testing / Quality Assurance

- Manual and automated testing (unit, integration, E2E)
- Bug triage and resolution
- Load/performance testing (if needed for MVP)

## 7. Deployment / Release

- CI/CD pipeline execution
- Staging → production deployment
- Feature gating or phased rollout

## 8. Validation / Feedback

- Monitor logs, metrics, usage analytics
- Gather user feedback and support tickets
- Iterate based on insights (fixes or new features)

## 9. Maintenance / Iteration

- Patch bugs, optimize performance
- Build enhancements based on roadmap
- Maintain documentation and onboarding tools
