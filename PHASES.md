# Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) Phases

A clear and comprehensive guide to the phases in the Software Development Life Cycle, adaptable to waterfall, agile, or hybrid approaches.

This document outlines the key phases involved in software development, from initial ideation through ongoing maintenance. Each phase includes specific activities and deliverables that help ensure successful project outcomes.

## 1. Ideation / Discovery

**Purpose:** Discover opportunities and validate problem spaces before committing resources.

- Define the problem and opportunity space
- Conduct stakeholder interviews, market research, and user research
- Generate initial product ideas and feature hypotheses

## 2. Requirements / Scoping

**Purpose:** Define what will be built and establish clear boundaries for the project.

- Document functional and non-functional requirements
- Define MVP scope and success criteria
- Prioritize features (MoSCoW, RICE, etc.)

## 3. Design / Architecture

**Purpose:** Create detailed blueprints for both user experience and technical implementation.

- **UX**: User journeys, wireframes, user testing
- **UI**: Visual design, accessibility, design system integration
- **Technical**: System architecture, API contracts, data models

## 4. Planning / Backlog Grooming

**Purpose:** Break down work into manageable chunks and establish delivery timelines.

- Create user stories, epics, milestones
- Define sprints or iterations
- Estimate effort (story points, hours)

## 5. Implementation / Development

**Purpose:** Transform designs and requirements into working software.

- Write code: frontend, backend, infrastructure, mobile
- Integrate APIs, services, and third-party tools
- Version control, code review, feature flags

## 6. Testing / Quality Assurance

**Purpose:** Ensure software meets quality standards and works as intended.

- Manual and automated testing (unit, integration, E2E)
- Bug triage and resolution
- Load/performance testing (if needed for MVP)

## 7. Deployment / Release

**Purpose:** Safely deliver software to production environments.

- CI/CD pipeline execution
- Staging → production deployment
- Feature gating or phased rollout

## 8. Validation / Feedback

**Purpose:** Measure success and gather insights for continuous improvement.

- Monitor logs, metrics, usage analytics
- Gather user feedback and support tickets
- Iterate based on insights (fixes or new features)

## 9. Maintenance / Iteration

**Purpose:** Keep software healthy, secure, and evolving with user needs.

- Patch bugs, optimize performance
- Build enhancements based on roadmap
- Maintain documentation and onboarding tools

## Notes

- These phases often overlap and iterate in agile methodologies
- The specific activities within each phase may vary based on project type and team structure
- Regular retrospectives help improve the process over time
