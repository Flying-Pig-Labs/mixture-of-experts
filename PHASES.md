Clear and comprehensive list of **phases in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** — adaptable to waterfall, agile, or hybrid approaches:

---

## 1. **Ideation / Discovery**

* Define the problem and opportunity space
* Conduct stakeholder interviews, market research, and user research
* Generate initial product ideas and feature hypotheses

---

## 2. **Requirements / Scoping**

* Document functional and non-functional requirements
* Define MVP scope and success criteria
* Prioritize features (MoSCoW, RICE, etc.)

---

## 3. **Design / Architecture**

* UX: User journeys, wireframes, user testing
* UI: Visual design, accessibility, design system integration
* Technical: System architecture, API contracts, data models

---

## 4. **Planning / Backlog Grooming**

* Create user stories, epics, milestones
* Define sprints or iterations
* Estimate effort (story points, hours)

---

## 5. **Implementation / Development**

* Write code: frontend, backend, infrastructure, mobile
* Integrate APIs, services, and third-party tools
* Version control, code review, feature flags

---

## 6. **Testing / Quality Assurance**

* Manual and automated testing (unit, integration, E2E)
* Bug triage and resolution
* Load/performance testing (if needed for MVP)

---

## 7. **Deployment / Release**

* CI/CD pipeline execution
* Staging → production deployment
* Feature gating or phased rollout

---

## 8. **Validation / Feedback**

* Monitor logs, metrics, usage analytics
* Gather user feedback and support tickets
* Iterate based on insights (fixes or new features)

---

## 9. **Maintenance / Iteration**

* Patch bugs, optimize performance
* Build enhancements based on roadmap
* Maintain documentation and onboarding tools
