# Description
short_description: "Score and compare options across multiple weighted criteria"

long_description: |
  A Weighted Decision Matrix (also called Weighted Scoring Model or Decision Matrix
  Analysis) is a systematic approach to comparing multiple options across several
  criteria with explicit importance weightings.

  This method is particularly valuable when:
  - You have 2+ options to choose from
  - Multiple factors matter for the decision
  - Different factors have different levels of importance
  - You want an objective, defensible decision process

  The framework works by:
  1. Listing all viable options
  2. Identifying evaluation criteria
  3. Assigning importance weights to criteria (sum to 1.0)
  4. Scoring each option on each criterion (typically 1-10)
  5. Calculating weighted scores (score × weight)
  6. Summing to get total score per option

  Benefits:
  - Makes implicit trade-offs explicit
  - Reduces bias through structured evaluation
  - Easy to communicate and justify decisions
  - Supports sensitivity analysis
  - Collaborative (team can debate weights and scores)

  Limitations:
  - Can create false precision (8 vs 7.5?)
  - Assumes linear relationships between criteria
  - May miss qualitative factors that don't score well
  - Weights and scores are subjective despite numeric format

# When to use
best_for:
  - Vendor/supplier selection
  - Hiring decisions (comparing candidates)
  - Technology choices (build vs buy, framework selection)
  - Feature prioritization
  - Location selection (office, market expansion)
  - Investment/allocation decisions

avoid_when:
  - Only one criterion matters (just optimize that)
  - Options are not comparable (apples to oranges)
  - Need rapid decision (too time-consuming)
  - Criteria cannot be meaningfully scored
  - Decision is heavily qualitative/emotional

# Difficulty and time
complexity: simple
estimated_time_minutes: 30
expertise_required: none

# Required inputs
required_inputs:
  - id: options
    prompt: "List all the options you're deciding between (comma-separated)"
    type: list
    placeholder: "Option A, Option B, Option C"
    guidance: |
      Include all viable alternatives. Typically 2-8 options.
      If you have >10 options, consider pre-filtering first.
    validation:
      min_items: 2
      max_items: 10

  - id: criteria
    prompt: "What criteria matter for this decision? (comma-separated)"
    type: list
    placeholder: "Cost, Quality, Ease of use, Support, Scalability"
    guidance: |
      List factors that differentiate the options.
      Aim for 3-7 criteria (too few = oversimplified, too many = analysis paralysis).
      Make criteria specific and measurable where possible.
    validation:
      min_items: 2
      max_items: 10

  - id: criteria_weights
    prompt: "How would you weight these criteria by importance? (decimal values that sum to 1.0)"
    type: weights
    placeholder: "Cost=0.25, Quality=0.35, Ease of use=0.15, Support=0.15, Scalability=0.10"
    guidance: |
      Assign importance weights to each criterion.
      Higher weight = more important to your decision.
      Must sum to 1.0 (or 100%).

      Tips:
      - Start by ranking criteria, then assign weights
      - Consider: "If I could only optimize ONE criterion, which would it be?"
      - Check: Does the weight distribution reflect your true priorities?
    validation:
      sum_to: 1.0
      all_positive: true
      depends_on: criteria

  - id: scores
    prompt: "Score each option on each criterion (1-10 scale, where 10 is best)"
    type: multiline
    placeholder: |
      Option A: Cost=8, Quality=7, Ease of use=9, Support=6, Scalability=5
      Option B: Cost=6, Quality=9, Ease of use=8, Support=9, Scalability=8
      Option C: Cost=9, Quality=6, Ease of use=6, Support=7, Scalability=7
    guidance: |
      For each option, score it on each criterion using 1-10 scale:
      - 1-3: Poor/weak on this criterion
      - 4-6: Adequate/moderate
      - 7-8: Good/strong
      - 9-10: Excellent/exceptional

      Be honest and specific. If you don't have data, note assumptions.
    validation:
      min_length: 20

# Optional inputs
optional_inputs:
  - id: constraints
    prompt: "Are there any hard constraints that would disqualify an option? (Optional)"
    type: multiline
    placeholder: |
      Option A: Must integrate with Salesforce (disqualifies if not possible)
      Budget: Hard cap at $50K/year (disqualifies any option over this)
    guidance: "List dealbreakers that would eliminate options before scoring"
    validation:
      optional: true

  - id: confidence
    prompt: "How confident are you in your scores? (Optional)"
    type: text
    placeholder: "High confidence on cost (real quotes), low confidence on scalability (limited testing)"
    guidance: "Note which scores are based on data vs assumptions"
    validation:
      optional: true

# Application template
application_template: |
  You are applying the Weighted Decision Matrix framework to help compare options.

  FRAMEWORK: Weighted Decision Matrix
  METHOD: Score options across weighted criteria, calculate total weighted scores

  PROBLEM: {{ problem_description }}

  USER INPUTS:
  Options: {{ answers.options | join(', ') }}
  Criteria: {{ answers.criteria | join(', ') }}
  Weights: {{ answers.criteria_weights }}
  Scores: {{ answers.scores }}

  {% if answers.constraints %}
  Constraints: {{ answers.constraints }}
  {% endif %}

  {% if answers.confidence %}
  Confidence Notes: {{ answers.confidence }}
  {% endif %}

  TASK:
  Provide a comprehensive weighted decision matrix analysis:

  1. DECISION MATRIX TABLE
     Create a clear table showing:
     - Rows: Each option
     - Columns: Each criterion with weight in header
     - Cells: Score (weighted score)
     - Final column: Total weighted score
     - Highlight the winning option

     Example format:
     | Option   | Cost (25%) | Quality (35%) | Ease (15%) | Support (15%) | Scale (10%) | TOTAL |
     |----------|------------|---------------|------------|---------------|-------------|-------|
     | Option A | 8 (2.00)   | 7 (2.45)      | 9 (1.35)   | 6 (0.90)      | 5 (0.50)    | 7.20  |
     | Option B | 6 (1.50)   | 9 (3.15)      | 8 (1.20)   | 9 (1.35)      | 8 (0.80)    | 8.00 ⭐|
     | Option C | 9 (2.25)   | 6 (2.10)      | 6 (0.90)   | 7 (1.05)      | 7 (0.70)    | 7.00  |

  2. ANALYSIS SUMMARY
     - Winner: Which option has the highest total score?
     - Margin: By how much? Is it significant or close?
     - Strengths: What does the winner excel at?
     - Weaknesses: Where does the winner fall short?
     - Runner-up: Second place and why it's close/far

  3. CRITERION-BY-CRITERION INSIGHTS
     For each criterion, analyze:
     - Which option scores highest?
     - How much variation is there? (e.g., all similar vs clear winner)
     - Does the weight reflect true importance? (sensitivity check)
     - Any surprises in the scores?

  4. SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
     Test key assumptions:
     - What if we weight [highest-weighted criterion] less? Does winner change?
     - What if we weight [lowest-weighted criterion] more?
     - Close calls: If scores are within 10% of each other, note it's sensitive
     - Robustness: Is the winner clear or fragile to weight changes?

     Provide 2-3 "what-if" scenarios that would flip the decision.

  5. SCORE QUALITY CHECK
     Assess the scoring quality:
     - Are scores based on data or assumptions?
     - Are there criteria where all options score similarly? (may not be differentiating)
     - Are there criteria with extreme score variance? (may be decisive)
     - Bias check: Is there evidence of halo effect or confirmation bias?

  6. QUALITATIVE FACTORS
     Beyond the numbers:
     - What important factors aren't captured in the criteria?
     - Are there intangibles (trust, cultural fit, future potential)?
     - Second-order effects: Consequences of this choice 6-12 months out?
     - Optionality: Does one option preserve more flexibility?

  7. RECOMMENDATION
     - Recommended option: Based on highest weighted score
     - Confidence: X% (consider score margin, data quality, sensitivity)
     - Conditions: "Choose Option B IF..." (state assumptions)
     - Decision clarity: Clear winner vs. too close to call
     - Next steps: What validation would increase confidence?

  8. IMPLEMENTATION CONSIDERATIONS
     For the recommended option:
     - What are the immediate next steps?
     - What risks need mitigation?
     - What's the expected timeline?
     - Who needs to be involved?

  FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:
  - Use markdown tables for the matrix
  - Show both raw scores and weighted scores
  - Highlight the winner clearly
  - Provide actionable insights, not just numbers
  - Note assumptions and confidence levels
  - Include sensitivity analysis
  - Be honest about limitations of the scoring

# Examples
examples:
  - name: "Vendor Selection for CRM System"
    problem: "Choose a CRM vendor for our 50-person sales team"
    answers:
      options:
        - Salesforce
        - HubSpot
        - Pipedrive
      criteria:
        - Cost
        - Features
        - Ease of use
        - Integration
        - Support
      criteria_weights: "Cost=0.20, Features=0.30, Ease of use=0.25, Integration=0.15, Support=0.10"
      scores: |
        Salesforce: Cost=4, Features=10, Ease of use=6, Integration=9, Support=8
        HubSpot: Cost=7, Features=8, Ease of use=9, Integration=8, Support=9
        Pipedrive: Cost=9, Features=6, Ease of use=8, Integration=6, Support=7
      constraints: "Must integrate with our existing MarTech stack (Salesforce and HubSpot both do)"
    outcome: |
      Matrix Analysis:
      - HubSpot: 8.15 weighted score (winner)
      - Salesforce: 7.45
      - Pipedrive: 7.35

      Key insight: Despite Salesforce having superior features (10/10), HubSpot wins
      on the combination of ease of use (highest weight after features) and better cost.

      Sensitivity: If we increase Features weight to >40%, Salesforce wins.
      Recommendation: HubSpot for current needs, but reassess if we need enterprise
      features (forecasting, advanced automation) in next 12 months.

  - name: "Hiring: Choose between 3 Senior Engineer Candidates"
    problem: "Hire senior backend engineer from 3 finalists"
    answers:
      options:
        - Candidate A (internal)
        - Candidate B (external, scale-up background)
        - Candidate C (external, Big Tech background)
      criteria:
        - Technical skill
        - Culture fit
        - Ramp time
        - Cost
        - Leadership potential
      criteria_weights: "Technical skill=0.30, Culture fit=0.25, Ramp time=0.20, Cost=0.10, Leadership potential=0.15"
      scores: |
        Candidate A: Technical=7, Culture=9, Ramp=10, Cost=8, Leadership=6
        Candidate B: Technical=9, Culture=8, Ramp=7, Cost=7, Leadership=9
        Candidate C: Technical=10, Culture=6, Ramp=5, Cost=4, Leadership=7
    outcome: |
      Matrix Analysis:
      - Candidate A: 7.95 (winner by small margin)
      - Candidate B: 8.20 (actual winner)
      - Candidate C: 7.05

      Surprise: Internal candidate (A) scored high due to culture fit and zero ramp time,
      but Candidate B edges out with stronger technical skills and leadership potential.

      Sensitivity: Decision is VERY close (within 0.25 points). Small changes in
      scoring could flip it. Recommended: Do trial project with both A and B to
      gather more data before final decision.

      Qualitative note: Candidate C from Big Tech may have culture adaptation issues
      (scored 6/10) - our startup pace is very different. Proceed with caution.

  - name: "Product Roadmap: Feature Prioritization"
    problem: "Choose which 2 features to build in Q2 from 5 candidates"
    answers:
      options:
        - Advanced analytics dashboard
        - Mobile app (iOS)
        - API for integrations
        - Improved onboarding
        - AI-powered recommendations
      criteria:
        - User value
        - Business impact
        - Development effort
        - Technical risk
        - Strategic fit
      criteria_weights: "User value=0.25, Business impact=0.30, Development effort=0.20, Technical risk=0.10, Strategic fit=0.15"
      scores: |
        Advanced analytics: User value=7, Business impact=6, Dev effort=3, Tech risk=6, Strategic fit=8
        Mobile app: User value=9, Business impact=9, Dev effort=2, Tech risk=7, Strategic fit=9
        API integrations: User value=8, Business impact=7, Dev effort=7, Tech risk=8, Strategic fit=7
        Improved onboarding: User value=8, Business impact=8, Dev effort=9, Tech risk=9, Strategic fit=6
        AI recommendations: User value=7, Business impact=7, Dev effort=3, Tech risk=4, Strategic fit=8
      constraints: "Team capacity = 20 story points. Onboarding=3pts, API=5pts, Mobile=13pts, Analytics=8pts, AI=10pts"
    outcome: |
      Matrix Analysis (highest to lowest):
      1. Improved onboarding: 7.85 ⭐
      2. Mobile app: 7.65 ⭐
      3. API integrations: 7.30
      4. AI recommendations: 6.70
      5. Advanced analytics: 6.15

      Capacity constraint analysis:
      - Onboarding (3pts) + Mobile (13pts) = 16pts ✓ (fits in 20pt capacity)
      - Onboarding (3pts) + API (5pts) + Analytics (8pts) = 16pts ✓
      - Mobile alone uses 13pts, limits other options

      RECOMMENDATION: Build Onboarding + Mobile
      - Combined score: 15.50
      - Uses 16/20 points (efficient)
      - Addresses both UX improvement (onboarding) and strategic expansion (mobile)

      Alternative if mobile is too risky: Onboarding + API + Analytics (16pts, score 14.30)

      Sensitivity: Business impact weight is critical. If we reduce it to 20% and
      increase Strategic fit to 25%, API integration becomes top choice.
