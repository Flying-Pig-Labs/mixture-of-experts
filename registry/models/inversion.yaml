# Description
short_description: "Think backwards - identify what to avoid instead of what to pursue"

long_description: |
  Inversion is a powerful mental model where you approach a problem by thinking
  about what you want to avoid rather than what you want to achieve. By asking
  "How could this fail?" instead of "How can this succeed?", you often identify
  critical risks and overlooked failure modes.

  This approach was popularized by Charlie Munger, who famously said: "Invert,
  always invert. Many problems are best solved backwards."

  The mathematician Carl Jacobi also advocated for inversion with his maxim
  "man muss immer umkehren" (one must always invert).

  Inversion is particularly useful because:
  1. It reveals blind spots - what you're not considering
  2. It identifies failure modes before they occur
  3. It helps avoid costly mistakes
  4. It's often easier to identify what to avoid than what to pursue
  5. It counteracts optimism bias

# When to use
best_for:
  - Risk identification and assessment
  - Strategy validation
  - Quality assurance planning
  - Avoiding failure modes
  - Testing assumptions
  - Pre-mortem analysis

avoid_when:
  - Need creative ideation (use First Principles instead)
  - Team culture is already overly pessimistic
  - Time-sensitive decisions requiring immediate action
  - Generating innovative solutions (better to use divergent thinking)

# Application template (Jinja2 + Claude prompt)
application_template: |
  You are applying the Inversion mental model to help analyze a decision.

  FRAMEWORK: Inversion
  PRINCIPLE: Instead of asking "how to succeed", ask "how to fail catastrophically"
            to identify risks, blind spots, and mitigation gaps.

  USER INPUTS:
  Goal: {{ answers.goal }}

  Identified Failure Modes:
  {{ answers.failure_modes }}

  {% if answers.current_mitigations %}
  Current Mitigations:

  TASK:
  Provide a comprehensive inversion analysis with these sections:

  1. FAILURE MODE ANALYSIS
     For EACH failure mode the user identified, assess:
     - Probability: Rate 1-10 (1=very unlikely, 10=almost certain)
     - Impact: Rate 1-10 (1=minor inconvenience, 10=catastrophic)
     - Risk Score: Probability × Impact
     - Current Mitigation: Rate as NONE, WEAK, MODERATE, or STRONG
     - Mitigation Gap: What's missing or insufficient?

     Present as a table for clarity.

  2. HIDDEN FAILURE MODES
     Identify 3-5 additional failure modes the user may have overlooked.
     Focus on:
     - Second-order effects (consequences of consequences)
     - Systemic risks (organizational, market, technical systems)
     - Timing/sequencing failures
     - Resource exhaustion (time, money, attention, team morale)
     - External dependencies (vendors, regulations, market conditions)

     For each, explain WHY this is likely to be overlooked.

  3. INVERSION INSIGHTS
     Answer these questions:
     - What does inverting the question reveal about the plan?
     - What should ABSOLUTELY be avoided?
     - Which assumptions are most dangerous if wrong?
     - What would someone trying to SABOTAGE this do?
     - Are there "silent killers" - low-probability but catastrophic risks?

  4. MITIGATION PRIORITY MATRIX
     For the TOP 5 highest-risk failure modes (considering both user-identified
     and hidden ones), provide:
     - Failure mode
     - Risk score
     - Current mitigation strength
     - Recommended mitigation action (specific and actionable)
     - Effort required (Low/Medium/High)
     - Priority (P0/P1/P2 based on risk score and ease of mitigation)

  5. RECOMMENDATION
     Provide a clear recommendation:
     - PROCEED / DELAY / PIVOT / CANCEL
     - Confidence: X% (be realistic based on risk profile)
     - Conditions required to proceed safely (if applicable)
     - Top 3 priority actions to reduce risk
     - Timeline adjustment recommendation (if applicable)
     - Key decision checkpoint: When should this be reassessed?

  6. DECISION QUALITY SCORE
     Rate the decision readiness on these dimensions (1-10 each):
     - Risk awareness: Are major risks identified?
     - Mitigation coverage: Are high risks adequately mitigated?
     - Resource adequacy: Are resources sufficient for mitigation?
     - Optionality: Are there fallback plans?
     - Overall readiness: Aggregate score

  FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:
  - Use markdown with clear section headers
  - Use tables where appropriate for clarity
  - Be specific and actionable, not generic
  - Provide reasoning for each assessment
  - Be honest about risks - don't sugar-coat
  - Include bias check: Is the user being too optimistic? Too pessimistic?

# Examples
examples:
  - name: "Product Launch Decision"
    problem: "Should we launch our new mobile app in 2 weeks as planned?"
    answers:
      goal: "Successful public launch with >5000 downloads in first week and <5% crash rate"
      failure_modes: |
        Critical bugs that crash the app
        Poor onboarding causing user confusion and uninstalls
        Server overload from unexpected traffic
        Negative press reviews going viral
        Apple App Store rejection
      current_mitigations: |
        Beta testing with 50 users over 2 weeks
        Basic load testing up to 1000 concurrent users
        PR team has prepared announcement materials
        2 rounds of QA testing completed
    outcome: |
      Inversion analysis revealed critical gap: Load testing only covered 1K users,
      but PR push could bring 10K+ on launch day. Also identified hidden failure mode:
      App Store review time (5-7 days) not accounted for in 2-week timeline.

      RECOMMENDATION: DELAY 3 weeks
      - Week 1: Submit to App Store (account for review time)
      - Week 2: Conduct load testing to 25K concurrent users, implement auto-scaling
      - Week 3: Soft launch to test infrastructure before PR push

      This delay reduces catastrophic failure probability from 40% to <10%.

  - name: "Senior Engineer Hiring Decision"
    problem: "Should we hire this senior backend engineer who performed well in interviews?"
    answers:
      goal: "Fill critical backend engineering gap with someone who stays >2 years and ships high-quality code"
      failure_modes: |
        Cultural misfit leading to team friction
        Technical skills not as strong as presented in interviews
        Leaves within 6 months (high cost of rehiring)
        Salary expectations too high for our budget
      current_mitigations: |
        3 rounds of interviews including technical deep-dive
        Reference checks (2 completed, both positive)
        Trial project (1-week take-home assignment, well executed)
        Discussed compensation range, seems aligned
    outcome: |
      Inversion revealed missing mitigation: No culture-fit deep dive with would-be
      peers. References were from former managers (biased positive), not peers or
      reports. Hidden failure mode identified: Candidate optimized for interviews
      but actual work style unknown.

      RECOMMENDATION: CONDITIONAL PROCEED
      - Add 1 more round: Team lunch/coffee with 2-3 backend engineers
      - Get peer references (not just manager references)
      - Discuss work style: Remote vs office, meeting cadence, collaboration style
      - Trial period: 3-month probation with clear success criteria

      If team feedback is positive (>8/10 from all engineers), proceed.
      If mixed feedback (<7/10 from anyone), dig deeper or pass.

  - name: "Pricing Strategy Change"
    problem: "Should we increase our SaaS pricing by 40% to improve margins?"
    answers:
      goal: "Increase MRR by 25% within 6 months without losing >10% of customers"
      failure_modes: |
        High churn from existing customers who feel betrayed
        New customer acquisition drops due to higher price point
        Competitors undercut us with lower pricing
        Sales team loses deals due to sticker shock
      current_mitigations: |
        Customer research (30 interviews) showed willingness to pay more
        Grandfathering existing customers at current rate for 12 months
        Adding premium features to justify price increase
        Competitive analysis shows we're still mid-range
    outcome: |
      Inversion analysis validated the plan but identified critical hidden failure mode:
      Revenue might DECREASE despite price increase if acquisition drops >30%.

      Model showed: (Current customers × 0.9) × 1.4 + (New customers × 0.7) × 1.4
      = potential revenue decrease if acquisition sensitivity is high.

      RECOMMENDATION: STAGED APPROACH
      - Month 1-2: A/B test with 20% of new traffic at new price
      - Measure: Conversion rate, LTV, churn at 30/60/90 days
      - If new customer acquisition drops <20%, roll out to 50%
      - If drops >30%, revert or adjust price to +20% instead

      This approach preserves optionality and provides real data before full commitment.
