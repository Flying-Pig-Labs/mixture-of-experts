## Using These Frameworks

All frameworks from these images have been transcribed, organized, and consolidated in the **[Cognitive Frameworks Library](../COGNITIVE_FRAMEWORKS_LIBRARY.md)**.

The library provides:
- ✅ Detailed descriptions of each framework
- ✅ When to use each framework
- ✅ How to apply them
- ✅ Quick reference matrices by use case, complexity, and time
- ✅ Integration guidance for the MoE system
