## Information Processing Biases

### Anchoring and Adjustment
- **Anchoring bias** - Over-reliance on the first piece of information encountered
- **Conservatism bias** - Insufficient revision of beliefs when presented with new evidence
- **Functional fixedness** - Limits on using an object only in the traditional way
